  { q: "What results can I expect, and how soon?", a: "Within the first 30 days, you will see measurable movement in search results вЂ” positive and neutral content begins appearing and pushing down unwanted material. By month three, most clients see negative content pushed off the first two pages of Google. We start with a free 24-hour audit." },
  { q: "How do you do this вЂ” and is it all above board?", a: "Everything we do is fully compliant and transparent. We build high-quality content across authoritative platforms, work with review sites through official dispute processes, and strengthen your presence on Google, Avvo, Trustpilot, Yelp, TripAdvisor. No bots, no fake reviews." },
  { q: "How much does this cost and why?", a: "Our starting engagement is $1,500 per month with a recommended minimum of three months. You get a dedicated team: strategist, content specialists, SEO professional, and platform relations manager. Cheaper services almost always mean grey-hat tactics." },
  { q: "What if I am not satisfied вЂ” do I get my money back?", a: "Yes. We do not lock you into annual contracts. You pay month to month вЂ” if at any point the work is not delivering, we stop and refund unused months immediately. No negotiations, no conditions." },
  { q: "How will you keep me informed along the way?", a: "Every two weeks you receive a progress report. At month end вЂ” a comprehensive report and strategic discussion with our CEO. Every client has a personal direct line to our CEO, any time, any day. Messaging only, no mandatory calls." },
  { q: "Have you worked with businesses like mine before?", a: "Yes вЂ” law firms, real estate agencies, boutique hotels, and fintech companies are our core clients. We will walk you through real before-and-after case studies. If we have not worked in your niche, we will say so upfront." },
  { q: "Can negative reviews actually be removed, or just pushed down?", a: "Both are possible. Removal works when a review violates platform terms: defamatory content, competitor reviews, fake accounts. Otherwise we use strategic suppression вЂ” building enough positive content to push negatives to page three or four." },
  { q: "What happens after the engagement ends вЂ” will the results last?", a: "Quality content on authoritative domains holds position for a long time. We recommend a lighter maintenance package after the initial engagement to monitor new mentions and protect what we have built." },

                <div className="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  <p>I founded Veliev & Co after observing a recurring structural weakness in high-value businesses: companies invest heavily in growth, operations and legal protection yet treat reputation as an afterthought. In competitive industries, that gap becomes a liability. A single unmanaged search result, an outdated profile, a fragmented review ecosystem вЂ” these are not marketing issues. They are risk exposures. We built a structured framework that transforms digital presence into a controlled asset. Not through noise. Not through PR theatrics. Through architecture, measurement and disciplined execution.</p>
                  <p>Because in business, trust compounds or deteriorates. There is no neutral state. So the only question that matters: Is your reputation compounding or eroding while you focus elsewhere?</p>
